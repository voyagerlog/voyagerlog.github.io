        <span>Voyager Design Mentorship Program</span>

  <main>
    <p>You took the design course. Maybe you even got your degree. Now what?</p>
    <h2>What are you offering?</h2>
    <p>One of the biggest issues with these newer design bootcamps (and even formal design education tbh) is that it
      doesn't adequately prepare you to work with design that isn't yours to make final decisions on. Although I would
      love to create a formal design apprenticeship program, it's just not something I'm in the position to offer right
      now. This will be my first time doing this so I might change this over time but this is what I'm thinking:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>This would be a 3 month program</li>
      <li>
        <span>Bi-weekly scheduled video calls (If youâ€™re shy about having your camera on, thatâ€™s cool. Me too). These
          would have alternating agendas:</span>
        <ul>
          <li>Monthly scheduled calls where we can talk about where you're at with your career, what's frustrating you,
            what your goals are, what your obstacles are, etc.</li>
          <li>Monthly scheduled calls where you can present design work that is either finished or in progress, and then
            we can dig in and see where things are working and where they're not. A huge part of design is the ability
            to
            sell it. Let's work on that.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>I'll add you to the Voyager Slack so we can casually stay in touch day-to-day.</li>
      <li>Youâ€™ll have the option to take on an apprenticeship-like role for any of the less formal Voyager projects I
        work
        on. This isnâ€™t required, although encouraged. </li>
      <li>At the end of the three month program, we'll have a final exit call and do a portfolio + resume review.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Who are you?</h2>
    <p>My name is Taurean Bryant and I've been working in various design roles for about a decade and have dabbled with
      art & design for as far back as I can remember. I've done all kinds of design work for wildly different types of
      organizations. I've worked in big organizations with lots of red tape like MTV and the European Patent Office
      (hell,
      I work in healthcare tech now). I've worked in fast-paced environments like an agency with clients like Nike and
      Samsung. I've done work for fledgling startups before they were even ready to share their business with the world
      (some even before they landed on a name).</p>
    <p>I don't have a design degree (or any degree actually). In each environment, I had to learn how to navigate and do
      my best work all over again. I didn't have anyone to help guide me, I made mistakes, and plenty of times I thought
      about giving up. I want to help make that path easier so you don't have to go through the same struggle.</p>
    <h2>What is Voyager?</h2>
    <p>I tend to have a handful of my own projects running from time to time, often with other friends and at times for
      other friends. Iâ€™m a big fan of the vintage NASA aesthetic so Iâ€™ve been sharing a lot of that work under an
      umbrella
      brand Voyager. Itâ€™s more of an informal fun thing with friends and less of a serious agency operating as a
      business.
    </p>
    <h2>Why are you doing this?</h2>
    <p>I really just want to make our industry more welcoming for people who grew up how I did and didnâ€™t always have
      access to people who could help them navigate the corporate world.</p>
    <h2>What does this cost?</h2>
    <p>Nothing at all. Getting to work in our industry is an incredibly privileged thing. Use the privilege of working
      in
      our industry to care for and build a future for your own family. And wherever you can, help make our industry more
      inclusive to our people, especially those who are marginalized and oppressed within our own communities.</p>
    <h2>How do I apply?</h2>
    <p>I donâ€™t have a huge social media reach so this shouldnâ€™t destroy my inbox, but for now I think email is the
      simplest bet. Shoot me an email and just tell me who you are. Introduce yourself, show me some of your design work
      or just share some thoughts about design as a job or industry. Since this is my first time trying this out, I
      think
      I will only be able to manage working with one person. Iâ€™ll try to decide on a mentor within the next couple weeks
      and more importantly, Iâ€™ll do my best to make sure you get a response from me either way.</p>
